Objective: I want to modify the functionality of the "Use This" button in the AI-powered suggested replies feature. When the user presses "Use This," the suggested reply should be copied into the user's input textbox (not sent directly). The user should then be able to edit the suggestion before choosing to send it.

Current Behavior:

When the user presses "Use This," nothing happens.
Expected Behavior:

When the user presses "Use This," the suggested text should populate the input textbox where the user typically types their message.
The user can edit the text before sending it.
Components Involved:

SuggestionButton:
The "Use This" button is located in this component.
This component currently calls the onSuggestion callback but does not update the message input.
MessageInput:
This is the component where the user's input textbox is implemented.
It already has a message prop and an onMessageChange callback.
Implementation Steps:

Modify the handleUseSuggestion function in SuggestionButton to call the onSuggestion callback with the selected suggestion.
Ensure that the onSuggestion callback in MessageList updates the message state that is passed to MessageInput.
Verify that MessageInput reflects the updated message state in the textbox.
Specific Code Changes to Make:

SuggestionButton:

Ensure the onSuggestion callback is triggered with the current suggestion.
Example:

tsx
Copy code
const handleUseSuggestion = () => {
  if (currentSuggestion) {
    onSuggestion(currentSuggestion); // Pass suggestion to the parent
    setShowDialog(false); // Close the dialog
  }
};
MessageList:

Update the onUseSuggestion callback to modify the draftMessage state that is passed to MessageInput.
Example:

tsx
Copy code
const handleUseSuggestion = (suggestion: string) => {
  setDraftMessage(suggestion); // Set the suggested text as the draft message
};
MessageInput:

Ensure the message prop and onMessageChange callback correctly update the input textbox.
Example:

tsx
Copy code
<MessageInput
  onSendMessage={handleSendMessage}
  onMessageChange={setDraftMessage}
  message={draftMessage} // Reflect the draft message
/>
